#+TITLE:Sbozzoloverlay

=sbozzoloverlay= contains misc ebuilds for packages that are not available
elsewhere or not updated enough. The quality of the ebuilds is poor, as this
overlay is for personal use.

** Installation
Install with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sbozzolo/sbozzoloverlay/master/sbozzoloverlay.xml -f -a sbozzoloverlay
#+END_SRC
Ignore the warnings about not being in the remote list, which are due to the
fact that this overlay is not official.
